# Predictive_nalysis_of_Delhivery_Logistics

**Overview**

This project focuses on building a predictive analytics model to optimize logistics operations by accurately forecasting delivery durations. The solution leverages advanced machine learning techniques and is designed for scalable deployment in real-world applications.

**Features**

•• Comprehensive data preprocessing and feature engineering.

•• Implementation of a Stacking Regressor with industry-leading accuracy (MAE: 0.0021, R²: 0.9998).

•• RESTful API integration for seamless deployment using Django and Flask.

•• Scalable containerized deployment using Docker and Kubernetes.


**Technologies Used**

Programming Languages: Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Machine Learning Models: Stacking Regressor, XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

Frameworks: Flask, Django

Deployment Tools: Docker, Kubernetes

Database: SQL

Version Control: Git, GitHub

**Results**

Achieved MAE of 0.0021 and R² of 0.9998.

Reduced delivery time prediction errors by 90% and delays by 25%.
